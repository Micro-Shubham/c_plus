/*
What is the purpose of pointer ?
Ans- A program can access stack but not heap memory .So for this to access heap memory pointer is use .
Program acess pointer and pointer access heap memory .Hence , a program can access heap memory only with
the help of pointer indirectly.
Second purpose:
Suppose a file is there in a disk and we have to access it but program can access indirectly only with the help
of pointer .Without taking help of pointer accessing that file for a program is difficult.We use file pointer to
access that file using pointer.
Third purpose:
A program can access network connection indirectly with help of pointer.
Forth purpose:
A program can access keyboard, mouse,printer etc indirectly with the help of pointer.
Pointer is available in C/C++.
Where as in java and C# they cannot do it because there is not the concept of pointer.
For access we have to use JVM or common language of run time in C# or dot net.


Pointer is only available in C/C++ .
By using C/C++ we can do system programming , we can develop even operating system , we can develop
the device drivers only the reason we have is pointer .
